<p>I'm a rock climber, full stack programmer, and happily married dog lover. As a graduate from Flatiron School's web development course and I'm thrilled to take my experience with digital marketing and sales funnels into building web apps. So far, I'm most comfortable with Angular and Ruby on Rails, but what I've really come to love about programming are the parallels with rock climbing. It's all about problem solving, whether the goal is to add a tricky style, create some complex feature, or ascend a 300 foot cliff one movement at a time. I'm currently looking for any opportunities to further develop my skill set where I can create or enhance awesome products. Furthermore, I would love to eventually tie those skills into working with UX.</p>
