<p>I've travelled the world, lived on a good number of farms small organic, read a bunch of books and met a ton of people in the process. The point is, there is a disconnect between people and our planet. Bridging that gap means coming to terms with reality and problems we face as a community, a society, and a species. Permaculture is a viable solution for those who wish to seek true self-reliance and sustainability. Offgridly is an opportunity for me to make this path better understood and more attainable. I'll start with the definition...</p>

<p>Permaculture: noun: the development of agricultural ecosystems intended to be sustainable and self-sufficient.</p>

<p>Now imagine an ecological view of agriculture where the system requires not input of energy (electricity/power) or supplies (fertilizers, materials, etc.) and nothing is wasted. The key is efficiency and developing a harmony of symbiotic relationships. The people merely live to facilitate this environment but in reality, if done correctly, the productive nature of said environment should be mostly maintenance free.
