<p>I've travelled the world, lived on a good number of small organic farms, read a bunch of books and met a ton of people in the process. The point is, there is a disconnect between people, our food, and our planet. Bridging that gap means coming to terms with reality and the problems we face as a community, a society, and as a species. Permaculture is a viable solution for those who wish to seek true self-reliance and sustainability. Offgridly is my opportunity to make this path better understood and more attainable. </p>
